***516 FW 2***:

**2.16** May the Service extend the due date of performance reports?

**A.** We may extend the due date of a performance report if we receive a request through a letter, 
fax, or email no later than 1 daybefore the original due date of the report. The request must 
identify:

 1. The type of report for which the recipient requests an extension,
 2. The requested revised due date, and
 3. A justification for the extension.

**B.** The maximum extension we may approve on either type of report is 90 days, unless a longer 
period is justified by a catastrophe that significantly impairs the recipient's operations.
    
**C.** We must notify the recipient by letter, fax, or email if we approve a request for extension of 
the due date of a report.

**D.** We must also keep extension requests and the final decision on these requests on file.
Please do not reply to this message. Contact staff (<#{ staff }>) if 
you have any questions.
